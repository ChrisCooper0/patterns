/*
Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

In Client-Side Rendering (CSR) only the barebones HTML container for a page is rendered by the server.
The logic, data fetching, templating and routing required to display content on the page is handled by JavaScript code that executes in the browser/client.
CSR became popular as a method of building single-page applications. It helped to blur the difference between websites and installed applications.
